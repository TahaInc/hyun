			<h4>
				Hey there, let me introduce myself, my name is Jeremie Hamel, and I am the founder of HYUN, a company
				where
				there’s always a story behind a style. It’s based in Ottawa, Canada. Let’s start from the beginning
				because
				every step counts and means everything to me. </h4> <br />
			<h4>
				A couple months ago, the idea of creating a brand popped in my head, but I never really went and
				committed
				to that plan. I was just being a very lazy person, without knowing what true potential I had, and the
				life-experience to acquire during this process, of being able to create a brand from scratch. As a
				korean
				teenager, there isn’t much of a korean community around my area, or in my everyday life, so it was
				somewhat
				hard to really find a connection with your culture. I know for a fact that many of us have their own
				culture
				that they surely appreciate and embrace. But for me, it wasn’t the case, I wanted to be able to have or
				represent something that had some quite a link to who I truly was. This is the reason, I called this
				brand:
				HYUN; which is basically my first name in korean. </h4> <br />
			<h4>
				It was appealing to me, because I knew that I would be able to connect and really have a passion for
				every
				product I created. It was a motivation for me to be able to represent what I do, since I never really
				had
				the chance to stand out on my own. I knew this was a really beneficial project for me to do. I needed to
				start somewhere, because honestly, I was pretty lost in what I had to do because I've never done
				anything of
				this size. I had to research everything about ‘’How to make a brand’’ on youtube, on the web, I was
				basically a rookie at this. After hours and hours of different research made on the subject, I finally
				felt
				ready to make the first move. But it wasn’t after a couple weeks that I actually starting planning, if
				I’m
				being truly honest. </h4> <br />
			<h4>
				I started in January, 2019. I brought a friend along who was a genius at computer programming that was
				able
				to help me start a website. Then, I had to plan some designs, what I wanted to sell, and make a plan
				basically. After that, I joined facebook groups, instagram accounts, on the hunt for a supplier that
				could
				create, from scratch, clothing products that I wanted, and ended up finding one, after many days on the
				lookout. My goal, personally, wasn’t to just slap a logo on a pre-made t-shirt (which is totally fine) I
				wanted to offer more, so it could be a challenge for me. I started drawing designs on papers and got
				them
				drawn and edited online to be able to send it to my supplier. That took a couple of weeks, since I also
				needed to buy samples, for quality check, which costed a pretty penny. It was primordial to do this,
				since I
				did not just want to offer a cheap quality product, since, well, nobody likes that. It took a couple
				tries,
				and a lot of communication with my supplier almost everyday. The website was getting done at the same
				time,
				and I was able to get some live samples shipped to my door, and I was pretty proud. Once I was happy
				with
				everything, every single little detail on the products counted. I got a lot of feedback from my friends,
				which were highly considered. </h4> <br />
			<h4>
				Throughout this process, I had to bargain a lot to acquire a price that was really fair for the
				customers
				and myself. I wanted to bring a high-quality product, for a cheap and fair price. Since every single
				piece
				is completely made from a roll of material to its physical shape, it was quite hard to get a low price,
				but
				fortunately, I got what I wanted! Now that I am here finalizing the website and wondering if even anyone
				read this, this is my story, and I hope you were able to understand my perspective and reasoning behind
				this
				amazing brand. I appreciate all the love and support, and hopefully see one of you guys embrace what I
				created. It’s more than just a company, it’s a story. </h4> <br />
